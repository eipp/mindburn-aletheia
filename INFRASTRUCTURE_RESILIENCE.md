# Infrastructure and Deployment Improvements

This document outlines the key infrastructure and deployment improvements made to the Mindburn Aletheia platform to enhance automation, scalability, and resilience.

## Automated Deployment

### GitHub Actions Workflow

A new GitHub Actions workflow has been implemented in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that:

- Automatically deploys infrastructure when changes are pushed to the `main` branch
- Supports manual deployment to dev, staging, and prod environments via workflow dispatch
- Configures environment-specific variables dynamically
- Provides deployment notifications via Slack webhooks

### Enhanced Deployment Script

The `infrastructure/scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh` script has been enhanced to:

- Support dev, staging, and prod environments with proper validation
- Configure multi-region deployment with primary and backup regions
- Check for required environment variables before deployment
- Create detailed deployment summaries for auditing
- Handle errors gracefully with proper logging

## Autoscaling Configuration

The API Gateway stack (`infrastructure/src/stacks/apiGatewayStack.ts`) now includes:

- Lambda provisioned concurrency autoscaling based on CPU utilization
- CloudWatch alarms for monitoring API performance
- Scaling policies with appropriate cooldown periods
- Metrics for monitoring API errors (4xx and 5xx)
- Configurable min/max capacity settings per environment

## Multi-Region Resilience

### DynamoDB Global Tables

A comprehensive multi-region failover strategy has been implemented:

- DynamoDB tables are replicated to a backup region (us-west-2 by default)
- The `DynamoDBReplicationStack` manages the replication configuration
- Automatic failover in case of a regional outage
- Real-time monitoring of replication latency and health
- Environment-specific configuration allows enabling/disabling multi-region support

### Monitoring and Alerts

- CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring replication status
- Alarms for high replication latency
- Metrics for tracking replication progress
- Detailed logs for troubleshooting replication issues

## Getting Started

### Deployment to Different Environments

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
cd infrastructure
./scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh dev

# Deploy to staging environment
./scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh staging

# Deploy to production environment
./scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh prod
```

### Enabling Multi-Region Replication

Multi-region replication is:
- Disabled by default in dev environment
- Enabled by default in staging and production environments

To manually control the multi-region setting, update the `enableMultiRegion` setting in `infrastructure/src/config/environment.ts`.

## Security Considerations

- All cross-region replication is encrypted in transit and at rest
- IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- KMS keys are used for encrypting sensitive data
- CloudWatch logs contain detailed audit trails of all replication activities

## Monitoring Recommendations

- Set up alarms for replication latency exceeding 2 minutes
- Monitor 5xx errors in API Gateway and set threshold-based alerts
- Track CPU utilization of Lambda functions to ensure autoscaling is working effectively
- Set up a dashboard combining both regions for a comprehensive view

## Future Improvements

- Add Route 53 health checks for automatic DNS failover
- Implement cache replication between regions
- Add more granular metrics for regional performance comparison
- Implement blue-green deployment for zero-downtime updates
