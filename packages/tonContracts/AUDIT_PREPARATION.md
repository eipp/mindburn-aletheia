# Smart Contract Audit Preparation

This document outlines the preparation for third-party security audits of Mindburn Aletheia smart contracts.

## Contract Overview

The Mindburn Aletheia platform uses the following smart contracts built on TON blockchain:

1. **UtilityToken**: A fungible utility token that provides governance and staking capabilities.
2. **WorkerReward**: Manages the distribution of rewards to workers based on task completion.
3. **MindBurnPayments**: Handles payment processing between developers and workers.
4. **WorkerReputation**: Tracks and manages worker reputation scores.

## Security Considerations

### Critical Functions

| Contract | Function | Risk Level | Description |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| UtilityToken | `mint` | High | Creates new tokens, risk of inflation |
| UtilityToken | `burn` | Medium | Destroys tokens, possible loss of funds |
| WorkerReward | `distributeRewards` | High | Distributes funds to multiple workers |
| MindBurnPayments | `processBatch` | High | Processes multiple payments in a single transaction |
| MindBurnPayments | `withdraw` | High | Allows withdrawing funds from contract |
| WorkerReputation | `updateReputation` | Medium | Changes reputation scores, affecting worker earnings |

### Permission Model

All contracts implement the following permission levels:
- **Owner**: Full administrative access
- **Operator**: Limited administrative actions
- **User**: End-user level access

## Known Limitations and Trade-offs

1. **Gas Optimization**: Some security checks are optimized for gas efficiency, particularly in batch operations.
2. **Centralization**: Admin functions create some centralization risks.
3. **Upgrade Mechanism**: Contracts use proxy pattern for upgradability which introduces complexity.

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage metrics:
- UtilityToken: 92% line coverage
- WorkerReward: 87% line coverage 
- MindBurnPayments: 90% line coverage
- WorkerReputation: 85% line coverage

## Audit Preparation Checklist

### Documentation
- [x] Code comments in all contract files
- [x] Function-level documentation
- [x] This overview document
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (in progress)

### Code Quality
- [x] Linting completed
- [x] Static analysis run with no critical issues
- [x] Gas optimization analysis
- [x] Removed all TODO comments and debug code

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for all functions
- [x] Integration tests for contract interactions
- [x] Specific tests for edge cases
- [ ] Formal verification (planned)

## Previous Findings

This is the first formal audit. Internal reviews have identified and fixed the following:

1. Reentrancy vulnerability in withdrawal functions
2. Integer overflow in batch processing
3. Missing access controls on reputation updates

## Implementation Specifics

### UtilityToken Contract
- FT implementation based on FT standard
- Implements staking mechanism with time-locks
- Governance functionality for voting on protocol changes

### WorkerReward Contract
- Batched reward distribution for gas optimization
- Time-weighted rewards based on task complexity
- Configurable reward caps

### MindBurnPayments Contract
- Escrow functionality for task payments
- Batched payment processing
- Multi-signature withdrawals for security

### WorkerReputation Contract
- Decentralized reputation scoring
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Time-decay function to emphasize recent performance

## Audit Focus Areas

We request auditors to focus on:

1. **Funds Security**: Protection against unauthorized withdrawals or transfers
2. **Access Control**: Proper implementation of permission hierarchy
3. **Gas Optimization**: Efficiency of batched operations
4. **Business Logic**: Correctness of reward distribution and reputation calculations
5. **Front-Running**: Protection against front-running attacks, especially in payment processing
6. **Upgradeability**: Security of upgrade mechanisms

## Change Management Procedure

After receiving audit results:
1. Categorize findings by severity
2. Fix all critical and high severity findings
3. Address medium severity findings where feasible
4. Document any accepted risks from low severity findings
5. Submit for follow-up review
6. Deploy to mainnet only after all critical issues are resolved

## Deliverables for Auditor

1. Smart contract source code
2. Test suites
3. Technical documentation
4. Architecture diagrams
5. Previous internal review findings
6. Access to development team for questions
