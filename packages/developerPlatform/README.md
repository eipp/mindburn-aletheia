# Mindburn Developer Platform API

This package contains the Developer Platform API for Mindburn Aletheia, providing authentication, task management, webhook configuration, and analytics capabilities for developers integrating with the platform.

## Features

- Authentication API with JWT and API key support
- Verification Task API for submitting and managing verification tasks
- Webhook Configuration API for real-time notifications
- Analytics API for usage metrics and billing information
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Comprehensive input validation
- Structured logging and monitoring

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Redis (for rate limiting)
- Docker (for local development)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
STAGE=dev
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
ALLOWED_INTERNAL_IPS=127.0.0.1
```

## Development

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the API locally using serverless-offline.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Deployment

Deploy to AWS:

```bash
npm run deploy -- --stage <stage>
```

Replace `<stage>` with the desired environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
