- **Decimals**: 9
- **Purpose**: Platform operations, fee payments, staking
- **Distribution**:
  - 40% Platform Operations & Rewards
  - 20% Team & Advisors (4-year vesting)

- **Quorum**: 40% participation required

## Economic Incentives

### Worker Rewards
1. **Base Verification Reward**: 
   - 10-50 MBU per verification
   - Multiplier based on reputation level (1x-5x)

2. **Reputation Rewards**:
   - Earn MBR for high-quality verifications (>75% accuracy)
   - Higher reputation = Higher earning potential
   - Monthly decay mechanism to maintain activity

3. **Governance Rewards**:
   - MBG tokens earned through consistent high-quality work
   - Participation in governance decisions
   - Staking rewards for platform security

### Staking Mechanisms

1. **Verification Staking**:
   - Workers stake MBU tokens
   - Stake size determines task access level
   - Slashing for poor performance
   - Bonus rewards for accurate verifications

2. **Liquidity Provision**:
   - MBU/TON liquidity pool
   - LP token rewards
   - Fee sharing for liquidity providers

3. **Governance Staking**:
   - Lock MBG for voting rights
   - Longer lock periods = Higher voting power
   - Earn platform fees proportional to stake

### Fee Structure

1. **Platform Fees**:
   - 2.5% base fee on verification tasks
   - Reduced by up to 50% through MBU staking
   - Fee distribution:
     - 40% to stakers
     - 30% to treasury
     - 30% burned

2. **Token Burning**:
   - Regular burning of platform fees
   - Deflationary mechanism
   - Increases value for long-term holders

## Security Mechanisms

### Economic Security
1. **Collusion Prevention**:
   - Reputation-weighted task distribution
   - Random task assignment
   - Multi-level verification for high-value tasks

2. **Stake Slashing**:
   - Incorrect verifications: Up to 10% stake
   - Malicious behavior: Up to 100% stake
   - Appeals process through governance

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Price Stability**:
   - Liquidity pools with balanced incentives
   - Treasury management through governance
   - Dynamic fee adjustment

2. **Market Protection**:
   - Gradual token unlocks
   - Emergency pause mechanisms
   - Multi-sig treasury management

## Performance Metrics

### Target KPIs
1. **Verification Quality**:
   - >95% accuracy rate
   - <1% dispute rate
   - <24h resolution time

2. **Economic Efficiency**:
   - >50% token utility rate
   - <5% monthly token inflation
   - >30% staking ratio

3. **Platform Growth**:
   - >20% monthly active workers
   - >40% token holder retention
   - >60% fee burn rate
