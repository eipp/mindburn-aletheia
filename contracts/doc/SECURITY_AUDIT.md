# Security Audit Plan for MindBurn Contracts

This document outlines the security audit process for the MindBurn token contracts on the TON blockchain. We recommend engaging a third-party security firm such as CertiK, OpenZeppelin, or Trail of Bits to conduct a comprehensive audit.

## Contracts to be Audited

1. **MindBurnGovernance (mindBurnGovernance.fc)**: Governance token with proposal and voting mechanisms
2. **MindBurnReputation (mindBurnReputation.fc)**: Non-transferable reputation token for workers
3. **MindBurnUtility (MindBurnUtility.fc)**: Utility token for the platform

## Pre-Audit Preparation

Before submitting the contracts to a security auditor:

1. **Complete implementation**: Ensure all contracts are fully implemented and tested.
2. **Self-assessment**: Conduct an internal review of the codebase:
   - Use automated tools such as TL-B (TON Language Builder) validator
   - Conduct manual code review with focus on security
   - Ensure all functions are thoroughly documented
3. **Test coverage**: Aim for at least 90% test coverage:
   - Unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests for contract interactions
   - Fuzzing tests for edge cases
4. **Technical documentation**: Prepare detailed documentation including:
   - Contract architecture
   - Function specifications
   - State variables and their purposes
   - Access controls
   - Expected behavior

## Audit Scope

Request the auditors to focus on the following areas:

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Access Control**
   - Verify only authorized users can call administrative functions
   - Check role-based permissions are properly implemented
   - Ensure owner functions cannot be called by regular users

2. **Token Economics**
   - Verify supply caps are enforced
   - Check for integer overflow/underflow in token calculations
   - Ensure proper token accounting

3. **State Management**
   - Verify state transitions are secure
   - Check for state inconsistencies
   - Ensure persistent storage is used correctly

4. **External Interactions**
   - Verify safe interaction with other contracts
   - Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities
   - Ensure proper handling of TON value transfers

5. **Logic Correctness**
   - Governance voting mechanism
   - Reputation calculation and decay
   - Token minting and burning logic

### TON-Specific Security

1. **Gas Optimization**
   - Check for potential out-of-gas scenarios
   - Ensure efficient computation to prevent excess fees

2. **TVM Specifics**
   - Proper use of TON Virtual Machine instructions
   - Correct handling of cell references
   - Efficient dictionary usage

3. **Message Handling**
   - Proper bounced message handling
   - Correct use of message flags
   - Secure incoming message processing

## Audit Deliverables

Request the following deliverables from the audit firm:

1. **Comprehensive Report** including:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed findings with severity ratings
   - Exploitability assessment
   - Recommendations for remediation

2. **Issue Tracking** with:
   - All identified vulnerabilities
   - Classification by severity and type
   - Recommendations for fixes

3. **Remediation Review** to:
   - Verify fixes for identified issues
   - Ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced

## Post-Audit Actions

After receiving the audit report:

1. **Address all findings** based on severity:
   - Critical/High: Must be fixed before deployment
   - Medium: Should be fixed before deployment
   - Low: Consider fixing or document acceptable risk

2. **Request re-audit** for critical fixes

3. **Public disclosure**:
   - Publish audit report
   - Communicate findings and fixes to community
   - Document known issues with mitigation plans

4. **Continuous monitoring**:
   - Set up bug bounty program
   - Establish security monitoring
   - Plan for future audits with contract upgrades

## Budget Considerations

Security audits for TON contracts typically range from $20,000 to $100,000 depending on:

- Complexity of contracts
- Number of functions
- Interaction with other contracts
- Timeframe for audit
- Reputation of audit firm

Allocate at least 3-4 weeks for a thorough audit, including remediation review.

## Engagement Process

1. **Request quotes** from multiple firms
2. **Select firm** based on expertise and availability
3. **Sign audit agreement** with clear scope and deliverables
4. **Provide code** and documentation
5. **Kick-off meeting** to discuss specific concerns
6. **Regular check-ins** during the audit process
7. **Review findings** and prioritize fixes
8. **Implement fixes** and request verification
9. **Finalize audit** with remediation confirmation

## Conclusion

A thorough security audit is essential before deploying these contracts to the TON mainnet. The investment in security will protect both the platform and its users from potential vulnerabilities and financial losses. Begin the audit process at least 6-8 weeks before your planned production deployment.
