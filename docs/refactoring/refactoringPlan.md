# Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the Mindburn Aletheia platform, focusing on improving code organization, reducing duplication, and establishing clear package boundaries.

## Goals

1. Create a clear, maintainable package structure
2. Eliminate code duplication across the codebase
3. Establish consistent patterns for common operations
4. Improve type safety and API definitions
5. Ensure all code is properly tested
6. Document architecture and package interactions

## Package Structure

The refactored codebase will be organized into the following packages:

1. **Core Packages**
   - `core` - Core functionality and system-wide utilities
   - `shared` - Shared types, interfaces, and utilities

2. **Domain Packages**
   - `developerPlatform` - Developer API and dashboard
   - `taskManagement` - Task distribution and management
   - `verificationEngine` - Core verification logic
   - `workerInterface` - API for workers
   - `workerBot` - Telegram bot implementation
   - `workerWebapp` - Web interface for workers
   - `workerCore` - Shared worker functionality
   - `paymentSystem` - Payment processing
   - `tonContracts` - TON blockchain contracts
   - `tokenEconomy` - Token economics
   - `pluginSystem` - Plugin system for verification methods

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Code Analysis and Preparation

1. Analyze code duplication using jscpd
2. Document current architecture and dependencies
3. Set up linting and formatting rules
4. Create package templates with consistent structure

### Phase 2: Package Migration

1. Create baseline packages with minimal functionality
2. Move all verification code to `verificationEngine`
3. Separate worker interfaces into appropriate packages
4. Consolidate payment processing code
5. Extract shared utilities to `shared` package
6. Implement core functionality in `core` package

### Phase 3: Dependency Management

1. Define clear package interfaces
2. Update all import paths
3. Establish versioning strategy
4. Create comprehensive type definitions

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. Implement test suites for all packages
2. Set up CI/CD for automated testing
3. Validate refactored code against requirements
4. Perform integration testing

### Phase 5: Documentation and Cleanup

1. Document all package APIs
2. Create architecture diagrams
3. Remove deprecated code
4. Update all READMEs

## Package Responsibilities

- `core`: System-wide utilities, configuration, logging
- `shared`: Common types, interfaces, error handling
- `developerPlatform`: API for developers, dashboard, analytics
- `taskManagement`: Task scheduling, distribution, monitoring
- `verificationEngine`: Verification algorithms, consensus mechanisms, fraud detection
- `workerInterface`: Worker API, request handling, authentication
- `workerBot`: Telegram bot commands, workflows, user management
- `workerWebapp`: Mini App UI, state management, user experience
- `workerCore`: Shared worker functionality, profile management
- `paymentSystem`: Payment processing, wallet management, transaction handling
- `tonContracts`: Smart contract interfaces, deployment, interaction
- `tokenEconomy`: Token distribution, staking, rewards
- `pluginSystem`: Plugin architecture, extensibility framework

## Success Criteria

1. No code duplication across packages
2. All functionality accessible through well-defined APIs
3. 80%+ test coverage across all packages
4. Clear documentation for all package interfaces
5. Consistent error handling and logging patterns
6. Type safety throughout the codebase
