# Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains documentation and resources related to the refactoring process of the Mindburn Aletheia codebase.

## Completed Refactoring Steps

### Preparation Phase
- ✅ Created naming convention guide in `docs/refactoring/naming-convention.md`
- ✅ Updated .gitignore with refactoring-specific entries
- ✅ Created batch renaming script (`scripts/refactoring/batchRename.js`)
- ✅ Created import updating script (`scripts/refactoring/updateImports.js`)

### Configuration Standardization Phase
- ✅ Created comprehensive tsconfig.base.json
- ✅ Enhanced ESLint configuration
- ✅ Enhanced Prettier configuration
- ✅ Organized scripts into appropriate directories
- ✅ Created migration script structure

### Directory Consolidation Phase
- ✅ Created scripts for test consolidation (`scripts/refactoring/consolidateTests.js`)
- ✅ Created scripts for verification logic consolidation (`scripts/refactoring/consolidateVerificationLogic.js`)
- ✅ Created scripts for shared configuration consolidation (`scripts/refactoring/consolidateConfig.js`)
- ✅ Created scripts for utility functions consolidation (`scripts/refactoring/consolidateUtils.js`)

### File Renaming Phase
- ✅ Renamed all files according to naming conventions (camelCase for files, PascalCase for React components)
- ✅ Created new package directories with camelCase naming

### Documentation and Validation Phase
- ✅ Created validation script (`scripts/refactoring/validateRefactoring.js`)
- ✅ Created developer guidelines (`docs/refactoring/developer-guidelines.md`)
- ✅ Created master refactoring script (`scripts/refactoring/runRefactoring.js`)

## Directory Structure

Before refactoring, package directories used kebab-case:
```
packages/
  ├── developer-platform/
  ├── payment-system/
  ├── plugin-system/
  ├── task-management/
  ├── token-economy/
  ├── ton-contracts/
  ├── verification-engine/
  ├── worker-bot/
  ├── worker-core/
  ├── worker-interface/
  ├── worker-webapp/
  └── shared/
```

After refactoring, package directories use camelCase:
```
packages/
  ├── developerPlatform/
  ├── paymentSystem/
  ├── pluginSystem/
  ├── taskManagement/
  ├── tokenEconomy/
  ├── tonContracts/
  ├── verificationEngine/
  ├── workerBot/
  ├── workerCore/
  ├── workerInterface/
  ├── workerWebapp/
  ├── core/            # New central package
  └── shared/
```

## Tools and Scripts

The following scripts are available for refactoring:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run refactor:rename-preview` | Preview file renaming without making changes |
| `npm run refactor:rename` | Rename files according to conventions |
| `npm run refactor:update-imports-preview` | Preview import path updates without making changes |
| `npm run refactor:update-imports` | Update import paths after renaming |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-tests-preview` | Preview test consolidation |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-tests` | Move test files to `__tests__` directories |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-verification-preview` | Preview verification logic consolidation |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-verification` | Consolidate verification logic into shared package |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-config-preview` | Preview configuration consolidation |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-config` | Consolidate configuration into shared package |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-utils-preview` | Preview utility consolidation |
| `npm run refactor:consolidate-utils` | Consolidate utilities into shared package |
| `npm run refactor:validate` | Validate refactoring changes |
| `npm run refactor:run-all-preview` | Preview entire refactoring process |
| `npm run refactor:run-all` | Run entire refactoring process |

## Next Steps

1. Perform a full test run to verify functionality
2. Update CI/CD pipeline to use the new directory structure
3. Remove old kebab-case directories once everything is verified
4. Update documentation in other packages to reference the new structure
